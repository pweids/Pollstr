# Pollstr


## About
Pollstr is an online voting app written for David Kosbie's [15-237 class](http://cs.cmu.edu/~237) at Carnegie Mellon University. It allows a user to create and run polls with 3 different polling methods.

It runs on Node.js with MongoDB, Express, Passport, Jade, Stylus, and Nib.

## Version
Version 1 is mainly backend focused.

Version 2 will include more front-end style and design focus

## Installation
Until a Heroku version (or otherwise dedicated deployment) is deployed, the app can be installed and run on any computer with Node.js and MongoDB installed.

Run Pollstr by doing the following in a Terminal:

    mongod --dbpath data/db
    run node app.js
